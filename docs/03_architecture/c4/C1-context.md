# C4 – Level 1: System Context

The Smart Farm System (SFS) interacts with two primary external actors:

- Farm Operators (humans)
- Edge Devices (physical systems)

Farm Operators interact via web or mobile interfaces.
Edge Devices interact via edge nodes and ingestion services.

The system abstracts internal complexity and exposes a single,
cohesive platform for farm monitoring and decision support.
