# Vision – Smart Farm System (SFS)

Smart Farm System (SFS) is a modular, scalable, and data-driven platform
designed to monitor livestock health, farm conditions, and operational risks
in near real-time.

The vision of SFS is to:

- Transform raw sensor telemetry into actionable insights
- Detect health risks early using rule-based and AI-driven analysis
- Provide farmers and operators with a unified, trustworthy dashboard
- Support gradual evolution from rule-based logic to predictive intelligence

SFS is not a monolithic farm management system.
It is an **ecosystem of bounded contexts**, each responsible for a specific
business capability, coordinated through well-defined contracts.

Key principles:
- Single Source of Truth for business data
- Real-time visibility without compromising data integrity
- Clear separation between decision-making and data ownership
- Architecture that can grow from pilot farms to industrial scale
